# PORTFOLIO WEB APP

This is my personal hobby project where I explore some of the ReactJS features
by building a small portfolio website. Some parts of code might seem
overcomplexed, but this is because I want to understand some of the new features
or just jiggle around with the code.

NOTE: For this reasons this project is considered as Draft and it is not a final
version. A lot of code will be commented-out, because I am testing / exploring
things.
