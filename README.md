# PORTFOLIO WEB APP

This is my personal hobby project where I explore some of the
[ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) features by building a small portfolio website.
I am using [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling the app.

Some parts of code might seem over-complexed, but this is because I want to
understand some of the new features or just jiggle around with the code.

**NOTE:** For these reasons this project is considered as Draft and it is not a
final version. A lot of code will be commented-out, because I am testing /
exploring things.
